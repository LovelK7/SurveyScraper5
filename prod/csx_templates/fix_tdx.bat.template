rem  STEP 4 of 4 - FINISH THE IMPORT
rem  Turns the file you saved in cSurvey into the finished map file.
rem  (slope/gradient/etc. lines get their arrows/ticks; sizes; water)
rem
rem  DO THIS RIGHT AFTER "Save As" IN cSURVEY, BEFORE YOU DRAW ANYTHING.
rem
rem  HOW: drag the file you just saved and drop it on this icon.
rem       (both .csz and .csx are fine - whatever you saved)
rem
rem  YOU GET: a new file next to it whose name ends in _lt
rem       -> OPEN THAT _lt FILE in cSurvey and do all your drawing there.
rem
rem  If the black window says BLOCKED, you dragged a file that has not
rem  been imported into cSurvey yet - read what it tells you to do.
rem
rem  Canonical copy: production\tools\fix_tdx.bat (this is a copy).
